NOISE #1: No-Input Feedback Instrument created with RNBO.

Play the no-input feedback instrument and look for the harsher noise. 
As long as you can play harshly, the more points you get. Try to make the highest score.

Be aware: harsh noise corrodes energy, and the system goes down unless you are moving.
